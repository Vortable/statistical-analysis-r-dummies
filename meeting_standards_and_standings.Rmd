To make valid comparisons across contexts, you often have to convert numbers into standard units.

## Catching Some Z's

A number in isolation doesn’t provide much information. To fully understand what a number means, you have to take into account the process that produced it. To compare one number to another, they have to be on the same scale.

Converting numbers to currency or tempertature units is easy - there's a formula to do it! 

When its not so clear-cut you can use the mean and standard deviation to standardize scores. Simpy take a set of scores and use their mean as a zero value and the standard deviation as a unit of measure. 

1. Calculate the deviation of each score from the mean
2. Compare that deviation from the standard deviation
3. Divide the score's deviation by the standard deviation

This is called the standard score or z-score.

## Sample z-score
$$
z = \frac{X - \overline{X}}{s}
$$
## Population z-score

$$
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$


##Characteristics of z-scores

z-scores can be positive, negative or zero. 
1. negative == score < μ
2. positive == score > μ
3. zero == score =  μ

Calculating the z-score for every score in the set 
 μ = 0
 σ = 1

## Bonds vs Bambino

Who's the greatest home run hitter: Barry Bonds or Babe Ruth?
At first glance Bonds hit 73 in 2001 and Ruth hit 60 in 1927

A home run was harder to hit in the 1920s that 2000s

Avearage home runs 1927 12.68 with a sd of 10.49
Average home runs 2001 37.02 with a sd of 9.64

Notice means are very different, but sd is similar. 

z-scores for Ruth = 4.51
z-scores for Bond = 3.73

Ruth's higher z-score means his result is far above average and stands out positively.  He is the clear winner when the results are standardized.  z-scores give context to a number. 

## Exam scores

z-scores are a pratical application to exam scores 

## Standard Scores in R

The R function for standard scores is scale(). It returns a vector of z scores, the mean and standard deviation. 


```{r scale}
Horsepower.USA.Eight <- with(Cars93, Horsepower[Origin == "USA" & Cylinders == 8])
print("Horse power from USA 8-cylinder cars")
Horsepower.USA.Eight

print("z-scores from USA 8-cylinder cars")
scale(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
```

## Population Standard Deviation
That last value is s, not σ. If you have to base your z-scores on σ, divide each element in the vector by the square root of (N-1)/N:
```{r population variation}
N <- length(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
scale(Horsepower.USA.Eight)/sqrt((N-1)/N)
```

## T-scores
The T-score, eliminates negative scores because a set of T-scores has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The idea is to give an exam, grade all the tests, and calculate the mean and standard deviation. 

```{r t-scores}

T.Hp.USA.Eight <- round((10*scale(Horsepower.USA.Eight)+50), digits = 0)
T.Hp.USA.Eight

```

## Ranking in R

Unsurprisingly, the rank() function ranks the scores in a vector. The default order is ascending.

```{r ranking}
Horsepower.USA.Eight
print("Ascending HP Rank")
rank(Horsepower.USA.Eight)

print("Descending HP Rank")
rank(-Horsepower.USA.Eight)

```

## Tied Scores
R handles tied scores by including the optional ties.method argument in rank().

```{r tied scores}
#replace 6th value to create a tied score vector for HP
tied.Horsepower <- replace(Horsepower.USA.Eight,6,200)
tied.Horsepower
print("Ranked average for tied scores")
rank(tied.Horsepower, ties.method = "average")

print("Ranked minimum for tied scores")
rank(tied.Horsepower, ties.method = "min")

print("Ranked maximum for tied scores")
rank(tied.Horsepower, ties.method = "max")

```

## Nth smallest, Nth largest
asking which score has a specified rank

```{r}
#arrange scores in increasing order
sort(Horsepower.USA.Eight)

print("The second lowest score is...")
sort(Horsepower.USA.Eight)[2]

#length or number of entries
N <- length(Horsepower.USA.Eight)

print("The second highest score is...")
sort(Horsepower.USA.Eight)[N-1]
```

## Percentiles
Scores are ranked and compared to see how they stand relative to the rest of the group.  Percentiles show how a score compares to others in a group, for example being in the 90th percentile means that your score is higher than 90% of the group. Percentiles can be greater than or equal to each other and this is an important distinction as greater than is exclusive and greater than or equal to is inclusive, changing the results. 

quantile() calculates percentiles defaulting to 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th,100th percentiles and uses inclusive values.

```{r inclusive percentiles}
quantile(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
```

Calculating greater than or exclusive percentiles requires that the type argument in quantile() = 6

```{r exclusive percentiles}
quantile(Horsepower.USA.Eight, type = 6)
?quantile
```

Return any percentile by including a vecot of those numbers or proportions.

```{r custom quantiles}
quantile(Horsepower.USA.Eight, c(.54, .68, .91))
```

## Percent ranks
The quantile() function gives you the scores for given percentiles. You can also find the percentage ranks that correspond to given scores. In order to do this in R you need to create a function.

The round() function with digits = 2 rounds the results to two decimal places.

```{r percentage ranks}
percent.ranks <- function(x){round((rank(x)/
length(x))*100, digits = 2)}

percent.ranks(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
```

Neat trick with Mean
If you want to know the percentage rank of a single score in a set of scores even if the score isn't in the dataset. 

```{r single score rank}
xx <- c(15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50)

print("The average for xx")
mean(xx)

print("The proportion of scores in xx that > 15.")
mean(xx > 15)

print("The proportion of scores in xx < 25.")
mean(xx < 25)

print("The proportion of scores in xx <= 25.")
mean(xx <= 25)

print("The proportion of scores in xx <= 28.")
mean(xx <= 28)

print("The percent rank of a score = 273hp.")
mean(Horsepower.USA.Eight <= 273)*100
```

## Summarizing

The fivenum() function in R, which is used to summarize a dataset using five key statistics. These five numbers are the foundation of a boxplot, a graphical summary of data introduced by John Tukey.

Min
Lower hinge (≈ Q1)
Median (Q2)
Upper hinge (≈ Q3)
Max

Note: The "hinges" are similar to quartiles but calculated slightly differently than the default method in quantile().

```{r hinges}
fivenum(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
```

The cool thing about this is that quantile can return the same results bysetting type =2.  looking at type in quantile will help customize results to different situations in the future. 

sumamry() functions provides mean, as well as quantiles, min, max

```{r summary}
summary(Horsepower.USA.Eight)
```

## Quantile Types in R

R's `quantile()` function supports **9 different algorithms** for computing sample quantiles. These are based on different interpolation methods and assumptions. Here's a summary:

### 🔹 Types 1–3: Discontinuous Methods

These methods **do not interpolate** between data points.

| Type | Description | Formula | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Inverse of Empirical CDF | \( Q(p) = x_j \) where \( j = \lceil np \rceil \) | Step function; jumps to next value |
| 2 | Similar to Tukey’s Hinges | If \( np \) is integer, average of \( x_j \) and \( x_{j+1} \); else \( x_j \) | Used in `fivenum()` |
| 3 | Nearest Order Statistic | \( Q(p) = x_j \) where \( j = \text{round}(np) \) | Closest rank |

### 🔸 Types 4–9: Continuous (Interpolated) Methods

These methods **interpolate** between data points.

| Type | Description | Formula Basis | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| 4 | Linear interpolation of empirical CDF | \( m = 0 \) | Piecewise linear |
| 5 | Piecewise linear with averaging | \( m = 0.5 \) | Median-unbiased |
| 6 | Default in Excel | \( m = p \) | Popular in spreadsheets |
| 7 | **Default in R** | \( m = 1 - p \) | Used by `quantile()` by default |
| 8 | Median-unbiased for normal data | \( m = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{p}{3} \) | Recommended for normal distributions |
| 9 | Approximately unbiased | \( m = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{p}{4} \) | Based on Beta distribution |

### 📌 Notes

- \( x_j \) is the \( j \)-th order statistic (sorted value).
- \( n \) is the sample size.
- \( m \) affects how the index \( j = \lfloor np + m \rfloor \) is calculated.
- Types 1–3 are **discrete**; Types 4–9 are **continuous**.

### 🔍 Example in R

```r
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
quantile(x, probs = 0.25, type = 1:9)
